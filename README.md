* 1. Graphs :
     A graph is like a map that shows how things are connected. It has points (called vertices or nodes) and lines (called edges) that link these points. Each point can stand for something, like a person, a place, or an idea.

* 2. Parts of a Graph:
  
Vertices (Nodes): These are the points on the graph. Each one represents something specific.
Edges: These are the lines connecting the vertices. They show relationships or connections between the points.

* 3. Basic Things You Can Do with Graphs:

** Adding: You can add new points or new connections between points.
** Removing: You can take away points or connections you no longer need.
** Finding: You can look for specific points or connections on the graph.
** Exploring: You can travel through the graph to see all the points and connections it has.
  
* 4. Where Graphs Are Used:

Graphs are used in many everyday situations:

Social Networks: They show friendships or followers on platforms like Facebook.
Maps: They show roads or paths between cities.
Technology: They show how computers or devices are connected to each other.
Games and Sports: They show how players interact or compete.
Brain Studies: They model how neurons (brain cells) connect and communicate.
Graphs help us see how things relate to each other, making them useful tools in many different areas of life.
